## Healthy at home

Some kind of fitness-oriented at-home-conditions website.
This is the final project for CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript.

#### Features

1. Calorie Calculator
2. Body Mass Index Calculator
3. To-do List
4. Workouts

#### Files & Directories

- `models.py` - ORM auth model. Contains an Code class which has user and hashed reset password code.
- `urls.py` - Contains all url paths for authentication, like login, sign up, as well as logout.
- `views.py` - Contains all view functions for authentication, like login, as well as logout.
- `templates` - Holds all html files.
- `static` - Holds all static files.
    - `css` - Contain all css files for styling the website.
    - `js` - Contains all JavaScript files for manipulating the DOM functionalities.

#### Justification

Why I think that my project satisfies the requirements?

Because it contains 12 HTML files, each of which has its own unique functionality(from about-stuff section, to different feature sections - profile, register and login pages, and so on). It also contains JavaScript on the front-end, has 2 Django-models on the back-end, and it is also mobile-responsive. It is sufficiently distinct from the other projects in this course and it represents an idea for fitness-oriented website for at-home conditions, which includes 4 different features. That's why I think that my project satisfies the requirements.
